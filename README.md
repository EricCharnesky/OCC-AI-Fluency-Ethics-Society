## Course Title
AI Fluency, Ethics, and Soceity

## Course Description
This course introduces students to the principles, applications, and societal implications of artificial intelligence (AI). Students will learn what AI is, how it works, and how it is shaping the modern world—from personalized recommendations and digital assistants to generative tools like ChatGPT and DALL·E. Through hands-on exploration, discussion, and critical reflection, students will develop the skills needed to use AI responsibly, ethically, and creatively in their personal, academic, and professional lives.
